# GPT-Projects

Welcome to GPT-Projects, a collection of small projects that showcase the use of OpenAI's GPT API in daily tasks.

## Projects

### Amazon Scrape

The Amazon Scrape project is a Python notebook that uses OpenAI's GPT API to extract product information from Amazon. Simply provide an initial query, the number of results, and your OpenAI API key, and the script will scrape the top search results and prioritize the products based on their relevance to the query and their properties. This can be a useful tool for anyone looking to quickly find the best products on Amazon for a given search query.

## Getting Started

To use the Amazon Scrape project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, along with the following Python libraries:

- OpenAI
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup

Once you have the required libraries installed, simply download the `/amazon_scrape/amazon.ipynb` file and run it cell by cell.
